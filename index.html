        <strong>Get Fit with League of Legends! The World&#39;s First Workout Program Generator 
        based on your game results!</strong></p>

        GFWL was designed and thought up by Detayl (Summoner, NA).

        The program generates a workout based on your in-game performance. This is 
        generated based on your stats in comparison to your teammates. This is 
        calculated by simply taking your score from the team highs/lows and the 
        difference is multiplied by either 5 or 10, depending on the workout.</p>
    <p>
        This program is in the beta stages and still has some work to be done to it in 
        order for it to be a polished product but will be maintained by Detayl.</p>
